# machina-learn
A respository I am making in order to learn ML and DL.

### Goals:
1. Create famous ML algorithms from scratch (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression etc)
2. Create a full neural network (both forward and backpropagation) from scratch
3. Basic DL projects using TensorFlow

### Progress:
1. Recreating famous ML algorithms: <br>
    i.      Linear Regression using Gradient Descent (Done) <br>
    ii.     Logistic Regression for Binary Classification (Done) <br>
    iii.    SVM (Not Done) <br>
    iv.     Naive Bayes (Not Done) <br>
    v.      Decision Trees (Not Done) <br>
    vi.     Gradient Boosting (Not Done) <br>
    vii.    Random Forest (Not Done) <br>
    viii.   XGBoost (Not Done) <br>
    ix.     DBSCAN (Not Done) <br>
    x.      K-means Clustering (Done) <br>
    xi.     PCA (Not Done) <br>
    xii.    Anomaly Detection usin Gaussian Distribution (Done)

2. Creating a neural network from scratch  (In progress. Can't seem to get the size of matrices right.)
3. Basic DL projects using TensorFlow <br>
    i.   MNIST multiclass and binary classification (Done) <br>
    ii.  Linear regression using NN (Done) <br>
    iii. Binary Classification using NN (Done) <br>
